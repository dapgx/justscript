# What is this script?

So, i just tired to delete every log manual one by one.
Then i create this script to automate it.
This script will delete every log file in the specified directory.
Just edit the directories (line 54).
You just specify what directory, month, and year.

For example, this script will delete every log file in /home/ubuntu/environment/dump/

log-example.2023-10-11.log
log-example.2023_10_11.log

every file contains <year>-<month>- and <year>_<month>_

month = 01 (01 for january, 02 for february and so on)
year = 2023

idk what i said and i don't know if you understand, but yeah, automation.
