# What is this script?

So, i just tired to delete every log manual one by one.
Then i create this script to automate it.
This script will delete every log file in the specified directory.
Just edit the directories (line 54).

For example, this script will delete every log file in /home/ubuntu/environment/dump/thelog.2023-10-11.log

every file contains year-month- and year_month_

idk what i said and i don't know if you understand, but yeah, automation.
